The iperf is a tool used for testing the network performance between two systems. The iperf application provides more metrics for a networks’ performance. The iperf application is not installed by default, but it is provided by most distributions’ package manager.

For CentOS/RHEL/Fedora Systems use the yum, to install the iperf package.

```
# yum install iperf
```

iperf has the notion of a “client” and “server” for testing network throughput between two systems.

The following example sets a large send and receive buffer size to maximise throughput, and performs a test for 60 seconds which should be long enough to fully exercise a network.

# Server

On the server system, iperf is told to listen for a client connection:

```
# iperf3 -i 10 -s
```

Here,
-i – the interval to provide periodic bandwidth updates
-s – listen as a server

See man iperf3 for more information on specific command line switches.

# Client

On the client system, iperf is told to connect to the listening server via hostname or IP address:

```
# iperf3 -i 10 -w 1M -t 60 -c [server hostname or ip address]
```
Here,
-i – the interval to provide periodic bandwidth updates
-w – the socket buffer size (which affects the TCP Window). The buffer size is also set on the server by this client command
-t – the time to run the test in seconds
-c – connect to a listening server at…

See man iperf3 for more information on specific command line switches.

# Test Results

Both the client and server report their results once the test is complete:
# Server
```
server # iperf3 -i 10 -s

# Reading the Results

Between these two systems, we could achieve a bandwidth of 15.4 gigabit per second or approximately 1835 MiB (mebibyte) per second.

Here,
Interval means the test interval, the defualt value is 10 seconds and displays as “0.0-10.0 sec”
Transfer means how much data is transfered between the two nodes in the process of testing.
Bandwidth is the performance indicator which we use iperf testing for.

## Note: The server listens on TCP port 5201 by default. This port will need to be allowed through any firewalls present. The port used can be changed with the -p commandline option.

# Testing network performance with UDP protocol

The default iperf uses TCP protocol for testing as shown above. Add option “-u” to use UDP protocol for performance testing.

1. First step is to start the server.
```
# iperf -s -u
------------------------------------------------------------
Server listening on UDP port 5001
Receiving 1470 byte datagrams
UDP buffer size:   124 KByte (default)
------------------------------------------------------------

[  3] local 1.1.1.1 port 5001 connected with 1.1.1.2 port 51598
[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth       Jitter   Lost/Total Datagrams
[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1.25 MBytes  1.05 Mbits/sec  0.004 ms    0/  893 (0%)
```
2. The command on client side is as shown below.

```
# iperf -u -c server
------------------------------------------------------------
Client connecting to 1.1.1.1, UDP port 5001
Sending 1470 byte datagrams
UDP buffer size:   124 KByte (default)
------------------------------------------------------------
[  3] local 1.1.1.2 port 51598 connected with 1.1.1.1 port 5001
[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1.25 MBytes  1.05 Mbits/sec
[  3] Sent 893 datagrams
[  3] Server Report:
[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth       Jitter   Lost/Total Datagrams
[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1.25 MBytes  1.05 Mbits/sec  0.004 ms    0/  893 (0%)
```
# Changing the default bandwidth in UDP mode
In the UDP mode, the client uses default bandwidth (1 Mbit/sec) to send the packets to the server, so we can see the Bandwidth of UDP testing result is 1.05 Mbits/sec. In order to obtain the best network bandwidth, we can add option “-b value” to increase the sending bandwidth:
```
# iperf -u -c server -b 1000M
------------------------------------------------------------
Client connecting to 1.1.1.1, UDP port 5001
Sending 1470 byte datagrams
UDP buffer size:   124 KByte (default)
------------------------------------------------------------
[  3] local 1.1.1.2 port 58097 connected with 1.1.1.1 port 5001
[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1.10 GBytes    948 Mbits/sec
[  3] Sent 806540 datagrams
[  3] Server Report:
[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth       Jitter   Lost/Total Datagrams
[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1.08 GBytes    929 Mbits/sec  0.010 ms 16203/806540 (2%)
```

# Measuring the Maximum Transfer Size (MTU)
The -m option instructs iperf to also find the Maximum Transfer Size (MTU):
```
# iperf -mc 192.168.10.12
------------------------------------------------------------
Client connecting to 192.168.10.12, TCP port 5001
TCP window size: 19.3 KByte (default)
------------------------------------------------------------
[  3] local 192.168.10.13 port 46558 connected with 192.168.10.12 port 5001
[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec   113 MBytes  94.7 Mbits/sec
[  3] MSS size 1448 bytes (MTU 1500 bytes, ethernet)
